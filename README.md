# unifal-ANN

This repository hosts the project files for the development of the final project of the Artificial Neural Networks discipline, which aims to validate the learning outcomes of artificial neural networks (ANNs) through the analysis of parameters of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks in solving supervised problems.

It was developed as part of the Artificial Neural Networks discipline at Federal University of Alfenas.
